> The data module invent a DSL for querying complex JavasScript Object graph both from server and on the client,

## Object Graph (aka. cache)

TroopJS query is built on an **object graph** implemented by `data/cache/component`, are essentially weakly referenced
standalone objects living in a big cache pool, referencing others only by an **unique id**, by utilizing weak references,
we're able to serialize the entire graph into big flatten JavaScript array that retains all the referenced objects:

Two objects, both have an unique id that is consisted of a resource type and an identifier, e.g. `user!troopjs` or `profile!0`.
`user` object is referencing it's profile by a **collapsed object** with the profile id, when querying for the
user object, say, from server, it is possible that user is only interested in user's "email" rather than the profile, making
the `profile` property optionally **expandable**, in this way payload on the wire is significantly reduced, eventually
allowing the client to re-assemble properties on demand:

It is an important consideration that Object Graph is of plain old JavaScript objects without imposing any intermediate
data structure, this makes it extremely easy for consumption, blazing fast and is future proof with data binding by Object.observe.
expiration is by adding a few additional *meta properties*, even granular cache control for each objects is feasible.

## Query

With object graph defined above, a tiny DSL is invented to pull objects out of the graph,
like `user!troopjs.repos.troopjs-core.pulls,.followers@2:3`, which syntax is consist of the following components:

  - resource type: `user`
  - id specifier: exclamation mark (!) following by id `troopjs`
  - property accessor which is dot notation (.) following by property, occurring one or more times - `repos.troopjs-core`
    - (optional) comma (,) separated multiple property accessors - `.followers`
    - (optional) range specifier for array values: at (@) following by a range  number - `2:3`

Then query API is a hub service provided by under the `query` topic which is implemented by `data/query/component`,
returning a promise that resolves to a list of the queried values:

When performing a query, what TroopJS does is much more than simply sending the query to the server,
instead it tries best to **reduce** the query from what we have on the client:

 - rather than querying all requested resource, reduce the number of queries by checking if the queried components already
exists in cache and is not expired yet.
 - rather than sending a request per query, reduce the number of requests by joining multiple queries into fewer
batched queries that are sent periodically.

In the above example, if you have queried for `user!troopjs.repos` moments ago,
this object will be returned immediately served from cache, eliminating the need for querying the server again,
a significant benefit coming from the fact that since cache reducing is transparent for the query service,
mock server communication is as simple as populating the cache:

## Cache Expiration

The GC is an optional optimization service provided by `data/cache/service` that take cares of de-referencing
any expired objects from cache to free out memories, it implements a generation-based algorithms for efficiently
determinate expired objects, each GC run should have very little impact on performance.
The GC will be running automatically as soon as the service is started.

## Persisted Cache

The built-in cache component is memory-based, but it's fairly easy to implement a cache component powered by
persisted storage, as an example for landing cache in local storage, checkout `opt/store/component` and
`contrib-browser/contrib-browser/store/adapter/local` for details.
