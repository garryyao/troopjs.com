## First TroopJS App

After the successful installation of TroopJS, let's start by creating a simplest application.

 - We create the widget `app/kickoff` that is a `troopjs-dom/component/widget` component started by the application,
which renders some greeting text, which is declared as the `data-weave` attribute on body element.

 - We bootstrap the application by creating a `troopjs-dom/application/widget` component that lives on the top-level page
element (`html` element) that is responsible for weaving all page components like the above `app/kickoff` one.


Now when you load the page you should notice the welcome message which indicate TroopJS has bootstrapped successfully.
