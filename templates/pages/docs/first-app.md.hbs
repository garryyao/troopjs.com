## First TroopJS App

Now that you've successfully installed TroopJS, let's start by creating a simple application.

 - Let's create a widget called `app/kickoff`, a `troopjs-dom/component/widget` started by the application. It will render some greeting text that's declared as the `data-weave` attribute on the body element.

 - We then bootstrap the application by creating a `troopjs-dom/application/widget` component that lives on the top-level page
element (`html` element). This widget will be responsible for weaving all page components such as the above `app/kickoff` one.


You're off to a great start when you see that the welcome message indicates that TroopJS has bootstrapped successfully when you load the page.
