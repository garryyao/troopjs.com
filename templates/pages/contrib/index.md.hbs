## Questions

We love questions, and we love knowing how you're using TroopJS. Please create a new issue in TroopJS's
revelant modules repositories, e.g. [troopjs-core](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs-core) but not in
the bundle [repository](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs) unless it truely cannot fall into any of the existing modules.

## Reporting issues

Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** To avoid duplicate issues, it would help us out if you could please check first to see if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in TroopJS's code with a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) that should be included in each bug report.
3. **Include clear examples.** Make use of jsFiddle or jsBin to share your isolated test cases.
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include version of Assemble, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.
