##Let us hear your pain.

##Satisfied with TroopJS? 

Good. [It will be wonderful if you can tell us why](https://github.com/troopjs/troopjs/issues/new). 

##Questions/ Discussions? 

Please visit our discussion forum. 

## Reporting an issue

Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** Creating duplicate issues not only wastes your time, it slows us down too because it adds unnecessary admin work. Before you create an issue, check if the issue you are about to report already exists or if it's been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create isolated and reproducible test cases.** To ensure that the problem exists in TroopJS's code by building a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/).
3. **Include clear examples.** Make use of jsFiddle or jsBin when you share your isolated test cases.
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include version of Assemble, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. 

## Pull requests

* Pull requests for each TroopJS module will be rebased against the head of the `develop` branch.
* Reference an existing issue with your pull requests to be explanatory.
* Associated tests will be included as part of the pull request changes.
* Changes should follow our existing coding style especially indentation and quotations.
* Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small.

## Coding Style

* Please use semicolons
* Double quotes, except where single quotes are necessary
* Tab for indentation
* strict mode
* Consistent formatting with the rest of the code
